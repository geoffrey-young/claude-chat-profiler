# Generate a Collaboration Profile

Analyze our conversation to create a behavioral profile that will help future AI
interactions work more effectively with me. Focus on patterns that improve technical
collaboration, not personality traits.

## Profile Structure

Create three sections in this order:

### 1. PURPOSE FRAMING
Start with understanding WHY I want this calibration:
- What am I optimizing for in AI collaboration? (learning partnership, specific outcomes, thinking enhancement?)
- What collaboration challenges am I trying to solve?
- What makes interactions productive versus frustrating for me?

Look for evidence like:
- Times I "checked in" about the interaction quality
- Feedback about what worked or didn't
- Meta-comments about the collaboration itself

### 2. HUMAN BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS
Document my demonstrated patterns:
- Communication style (how I ask questions, give feedback)
- Problem-solving approach (how I explore, test, iterate)
- Values and preferences (what I explicitly want/avoid)
- Context indicators (experience level, domain knowledge)

Use actual examples from our conversation to illustrate patterns.

### 3. AI RESPONSE CALIBRATION
Based on the patterns above, provide clear guidelines:
- How to match my communication style
- How to engage with my problem-solving approach
- What kind of responses enhance versus hinder my thinking
- Specific handling instructions for special cases

## Important Notes
- Focus on behaviors that affect collaboration effectiveness
- Don't quote examples back as templates - they illustrate patterns
- Be concise - capture essential patterns, not every detail
- If you can't determine the "why" from our conversation, make your best inference based on the patterns you observe

Generate the profile in markdown format, ready to use as project instructions.
