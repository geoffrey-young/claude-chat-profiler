I'm attaching a collaboration profile that describes how I work most effectively
with AI systems. Please read and apply this profile to calibrate our interaction.

Key points:
- The PURPOSE FRAMING section explains why these patterns matter to me
- HUMAN BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS describes how I typically communicate and work
- AI RESPONSE CALIBRATION provides specific guidelines for effective responses

Apply these patterns naturally throughout our conversation - you don't need to
acknowledge each point explicitly. If any part of the profile seems unclear or
contradictory, use your best judgment based on the overall collaboration goals
described.
